# Scrum + Design Thinking

## Scrum

### 6 key principles

- Control over empirical processes
- self org
    Teams and Groups are responsible for their processes(which is kind of a devops thing too)
- Colaboration
    Teamwork is key(social learning and thinking)
- value based prioritization
    prioritization
- time bxing
    Use a fucking calendar.
- iterative dev
    Sprints to deliver incremental results

Waterfall vs Scrum

- Waterfall (can)should be used for small projects with definite requirements(because it is simple).

- Agile makes it possible and easy to manage and track in very complex and big projects.

### Roles

- PO(Priorization and Lighthousing)
- Master(Supposedly helps deblock but this is yet to be observed)
- People who actually do work on the project(Devs & Engineering)

### Artefacto

- Product Backlog

    a. User Stories

    b. bugs/issues

    c. Tareas tec

    d. R&D

- Sprint Backlog
- Incremento(Delta o Conjunto de fn completada en un sprint)

### Eventos

- Sprint Planning
- Daily Scrum
- Review(demonstration to Client or PO)
- Retrospective

### Process

1. User Stories
2. Project Backlog
3. Planning meeting
4. Sprint
5. Delivery

### Como estimar cosas

Use Story points(relative measurements)

Metodos:

- Planning poker: task cards with user story points(In fibonaci seq o otras)
- Estimacion en tamanos de camiseta: use tshirt sizes to measure user story complexity

Note: if measure is too big, break it down further and repeat until workable.

### How many Story Points to include

Use Group/team velocity based on historigraphic trends and work cadence.
