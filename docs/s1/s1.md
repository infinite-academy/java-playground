# Sprint 1

- Utilitza per a tots els exercicis Eclipse o IntelliJ.
- No oblidis posar sempre les classes Java dins de packages.
- Es recomana crear per cada exercici un package de la següent manera: n1exercici1, n1exercici2, n2exercici1, etc.
- Pots construir projectes Maven, Gradle o només Java.

### Assignment 1: Hercia and polymorphism

**["OOP 101 - Oracle"](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/index.html)**

1. **["Object?"](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/object.html)**

   "An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior. Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life."

   1. Modularity: The source code for an object can be written and maintained independently of the source code for other objects. Once created, an object can be easily passed around inside the system.
   2. Information-hiding: By interacting only with an object's methods, the details of its internal implementation remain hidden from the outside world.
   3. Code re-use: If an object already exists (perhaps written by another software developer), you can use that object in your program. This allows specialists to implement/test/debug complex, task-specific objects, which you can then trust to run in your own code.
   4. Pluggability and debugging ease: If a particular object turns out to be problematic, you can simply remove it from your application and plug in a different object as its replacement. This is analogous to fixing mechanical problems in the real world. If a bolt breaks, you replace it, not the entire machine.

2. **["Class-y"](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/class.html)**
   "A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Created objects from a Class are called ´instances´ of said class."
3. **["Inheritance, you say?"](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/inheritance.html)**
   1. Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes.
   2. In the Java programming language, each class is allowed to have one direct superclass, and each superclass has the potential for an unlimited number of subclasses (One-to-many) rel. from Super.
   3. The syntax for creating a subclass is simple. At the beginning of your class declaration, use the extends keyword, followed by the name of the class to inherit from
   4. Caveat: Visibility. Gotta properly JDoc the SC so you get hints during dev
4. **["Touchy things: Interfaces"](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/interface.html)**
   In its most common form, an interface is a group of related methods with empty bodies.
   ``
   interface Bicycle {
   // wheel revolutions per minute
   void changeCadence(int newValue);

   void changeGear(int newValue);

   void speedUp(int increment);

   void applyBrakes(int decrement);
   }``
   Implementing an interface allows a class to become more formal about the behavior it promises to provide. Interfaces form a contract between the class and the outside world, and this contract is enforced at build time by the compiler. If your class claims to implement an interface, all methods defined by that interface must appear in its source code before the class will successfully compile.

5. "J-Packages"
   1. A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces.
   2. Java's (Standard) Class Lib is referred to as API
