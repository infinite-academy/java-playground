# Sprint 1

- Utilitza per a tots els exercicis Eclipse o IntelliJ.
- No oblidis posar sempre les classes Java dins de packages.
- Es recomana crear per cada exercici un package de la següent manera: n1exercici1, n1exercici2, n2exercici1, etc.
- Pots construir projectes Maven, Gradle o només Java.

### Assignment 1: Hercia and polymorphism

**["OOP 101 - Oracle"](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/index.html)**

1. **["Object?"](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/object.html)**

   "An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior. Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life."

   1. Modularity: The source code for an object can be written and maintained independently of the source code for other objects. Once created, an object can be easily passed around inside the system.
   2. Information-hiding: By interacting only with an object's methods, the details of its internal implementation remain hidden from the outside world.
   3. Code re-use: If an object already exists (perhaps written by another software developer), you can use that object in your program. This allows specialists to implement/test/debug complex, task-specific objects, which you can then trust to run in your own code.
   4. Pluggability and debugging ease: If a particular object turns out to be problematic, you can simply remove it from your application and plug in a different object as its replacement. This is analogous to fixing mechanical problems in the real world. If a bolt breaks, you replace it, not the entire machine.

2. **["Class-y"](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/class.html)**
   "A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Created objects from a Class are called ´instances´ of said class."
3. **["Inheritance, you say?"](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/inheritance.html)**
   1. Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes.
   2. In the Java programming language, each class is allowed to have one direct superclass, and each superclass has the potential for an unlimited number of subclasses (One-to-many) rel. from Super.
   3. The syntax for creating a subclass is simple. At the beginning of your class declaration, use the extends keyword, followed by the name of the class to inherit from
   4. Caveat: Visibility. Gotta properly JDoc the SC so you get hints during dev
4. **["Touchy things: Interfaces"](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/interface.html)**
   In its most common form, an interface is a group of related methods with empty bodies.
   ``
   interface Bicycle {
   // wheel revolutions per minute
   void changeCadence(int newValue);

   void changeGear(int newValue);

   void speedUp(int increment);

   void applyBrakes(int decrement);
   }``
   Implementing an interface allows a class to become more formal about the behavior it promises to provide. Interfaces form a contract between the class and the outside world, and this contract is enforced at build time by the compiler. If your class claims to implement an interface, all methods defined by that interface must appear in its source code before the class will successfully compile.

   2. [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/index.html]

5. "J-Packages"
   1. A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces.
   2. Java's (Standard) Class Lib is referred to as API

### Questions

Q: Are static variables references to an address in memory? So every class with `static int count = 0` share the same counter?

A: YES! It refers to where that variable is stored - static ones are stored inside it's class and accessed via the class itself(It seems to be stored inside the .class file too), not an instance of it.
So a single variable, with one address in memory(MyClass.myStaticField). These are not subject to garbage collection.

Instance variables(with no static or final - final is just a `const` for Class Variables) are stored inside the heap allocated to the object during runtime, not in the class file itself(you can have N instances, so no free optimization - Possibility of causing memory leaks via multiple unused instances? No because instances are subject to garbage collection)

More on variables:

If your variable stores a constant value, such as static final int NUM_GEARS = 6, the convention changes slightly, capitalizing every letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore character. By convention, the underscore character is never used elsewhere.

Local variables - are from a methods scope. That determination comes entirely from the location in which the variable is declared — which is between the opening and closing braces of a method.

Parameters - You've already seen examples of parameters, both in the Bicycle class and in the main method of the "Hello World!" application. Recall that the signature for the main method is public static void main(String[] args). Here, the args variable is the parameter to this method. The important thing to remember is that parameters are always classified as "variables" not "fields". This applies to other parameter-accepting constructs as well (such as constructors and exception handlers) that you'll learn about later in the tutorial.
